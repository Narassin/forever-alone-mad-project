## Objective

This mobile application project is a weather forecast checker application. As it is known, we have Malaysian Meteorological Department that will prepare weather forecast for each area in our country every day. This mobile application will facilitate the user to easily access the data just by using their mobile phones with internet. The users who want to plan their day or week ahead can benefit from this. 

To give an instance, a person who fancy hiking the hills or mountains must check the weather forecast for that day to avoid being welcomed with heavy rain which waste their time and energy for that day as they need to cancel their plan and return home. Another example would be someone who want to have a long trip using their vehicles, so they want to know if it’s going to rain. By checking the weather forecast, they can estimate their journey to be longer than usual because of slower vehicle speed.

This mobile application which is handy and helpful only requires the user to create and account and put their location. As simple as that, the surrounding temperature in that state and the weather will be displayed. Not just that it is very usable, it is also properly designed with simple and clean UI.

## Demonstration of the Application

As soon as opening the application, the sign in page will appear first. The system asks for email and password of the user. For first-time users and users who want to create an account, they can click on “Sign Up” button to move to another page.

The screen will change to “Sign up” page and the users need to insert their name, email, and password. The system will prompt the user under some conditions, such as weak password or used email. After signing up is successful, the application will bring the users back to login page and they can login with their credentials filled earlier.

Then , they will enter the page to check weather in their area. They only need to fill a state and the temperature and weather for that day will be given.

## Conclusion

Overall, this mobile application project is a success. It has UI designs that look clean and compact with enough information and buttons. The system retrieve data from an API that holds the data of weather forecasts. It does its job in a short time and doesn’t burden the user with a tedious process. The problem might be that the application could be better by having a table of weather forecast for different areas in a state or something like that instead of just a single area which waste a lot of space in the screen.
